Your submission will be judged on three criteria that reflect different aspects of a complete health data science analysis pipeline:

1. Research Question
2. Analysis 
3. Communicating results

The table below breaks down some of the things you should consider for each domain.

+------------------------+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
