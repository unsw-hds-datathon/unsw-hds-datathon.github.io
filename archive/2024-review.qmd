## Overview of the event


The second UNSW Health Data Science Datathon brought together more than fifty UNSW students across thirteen teams on 5-6 December, 2024. Participants dived into [EPIWATCH$^®$](2024-data.qmd) surveillance data, tackling the challenge of designing a data science pipeline to predict emerging infectious disease outbreaks.

Two infectious disease experts from the EPIWATCH project were on hand throughout the event to guide the teams. They provided invaluable insights, answered questions, and offered feedback to help participants refine their approaches to analysing the data and crafting effective surveillance pipelines.

The datathon wasn't just about coding and data; it was also about enjoyment and camaraderie. The teams enjoyed good food and had loads of fun.

Congratulations to all the participants! 

## The data

The [EPIWATCH$^®$](2024-data.qmd) infectious disease surveillance system provides near real-time monitoring for a range of infectious diseases and syndromes by scanning multiple curated and non-curated online news sources, including the WHO, CDC and Google News. 

Each record in the dataset represents a news article mentioning an infectious disease or syndrome. Minimum data includes the disease or syndrome(s) in question, the timing and location of the report, as well as the title and link to original online article.

<div style="font-size: 0.8em">
EPIWATCH$^®$ data provides an early warning system---the canary in the coal mine for the next outbreak. In this example, media reports of unexplained pneumonia foreshadowed a Legionnaires' Disease outbreak in Argentina, showcasing its power to detect outbreaks before they fully unfold.
