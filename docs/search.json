This event saw the participation of 22 HDS students working in six teams, five on campus and one hybrid online/on-campus team. The event focused on the Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV dataset, and teams were challenged to pose a research question and develop a solution using their health context expertise and analytic skills.\n\n\n\nHealth Data Science students in action 💛  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nFive experts were on hand to guide the teams, aiding them in crafting and executing their research questions and proposed solutions effectively. This included applied researchers with content expertise in HIV medications and machine learning, and Health Informaticians from NSW Health Sydney Local Health District\n\n\n\nConsulting with machine learning experts. 💛  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nThe datathon wasn’t just about coding and data; it was also about enjoyment and camaraderie. The teams enjoyed good food and had loads of fun. The presentations from all teams were highly engaging, with everyone putting into practice the technical coding skills and health context expertise from the HDS program.\n\n\n\nStudents presenting their work 💛  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nThe day culminated with a prize ceremony to acknowledge the hard work from all of the teams, and of course announce the winners! The winning team’s breakthrough came from using neural networks to predict the success of current ART drug combinations for patients with HIV. The second-place team used survival analysis to answer the question, “What drug combination is most effective at achieving viral suppression?” The third team investigated the impact of Dolutegravir (DTG) as a third agent drug on time to viral suppression among active HIV patients under antiretroviral therapy (ART).\nThis event truly blended learning, collaboration, and fun, capturing the true essence of data science in an enjoyable and rewarding environment.",

    "text": "Overview of the event\nThe second UNSW Health Data Science Datathon brought together more than fifty UNSW students across thirteen teams on 5-6 December, 2024. Participants dived into EPIWATCH\\(^®\\) surveillance data, tackling the challenge of designing a data science pipeline to predict emerging infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n\nUNSW students in action 💻  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nTwo infectious disease experts from the EPIWATCH project were on hand throughout the event to guide the teams. They provided invaluable insights, answered questions, and offered feedback to help participants refine their approaches to analysing the data and crafting effective surveillance pipelines.\n\n\n\nPresenting ideas to infectious disease experts. 💛  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nThe datathon wasn’t just about coding and data; it was also about enjoyment and camaraderie. The teams enjoyed good food and had loads of fun.\n\n\n\nFeeding the brain!

    "text": "The data\nThe EPIWATCH\\(^®\\) infectious disease surveillance system provides near real-time monitoring for a range of infectious diseases and syndromes by scanning multiple curated and non-curated online news sources, including the WHO, CDC and Google News.\nEach record in the dataset represents a news article mentioning an infectious disease or syndrome. Minimum data includes the disease or syndrome(s) in question, the timing and location of the report, as well as the title and link to original online article.\n\n\nEPIWATCH\\(^®\\) data provides an early warning system—the canary in the coal mine for the next outbreak. In this example, media reports of unexplained pneumonia foreshadowed a Legionnaires’ Disease outbreak in Argentina, showcasing its power to detect outbreaks before they fully unfold.",
